Jason Lai | Divinator (St. Louis)

is an oracular polyglot fascinated by the cultural history of divinatory symbol sets, and the oblique poetry and insight that emerges from ritualized sortilege and interpretation. His deep exploration of divination praxis began during his professional training in traditional East Asian medicine with the *I-Ching*, *The Book of Changes*, and has gone on to study astrology, tarot, geomancy, and several other oracle systems. Jason has lived on and off in St. Louis for 17 years, returning for the third time in 2020.

Daniela Molnar | Writer (Portland)

is an artist and writer working in mediums of language, image, paint, pigment, and place. Daniela is also a wilderness guide, educator, and eternal student. A cornerstone of her practice is to be resolutely non-expert and committed to change. Her book *CHORUS* was selected by Kazim Ali as the winner of Omnidawn’s 1st /2nd Book Prize. Her next book, *Light / Remains*, is a hybrid work of poetry, essay, and visual art and will be published in 2025. Her visual art focuses on transmuting grief to wonder in order to help shape and nurture generative new questions, feelings, and ethics about what it means to be human at a time of socio-ecological crisis.
